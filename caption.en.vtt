00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 align:start position:0%
you switch it off so it's actually in
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140 align:start position:0%
you switch it off so it's actually in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 align:start position:0%

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.620 align:start position:0%
competition with you so what do you
